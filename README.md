Using citypy allows us to easily identify citys around the world with a population greater that 500 using geographical coordinates.


 Three observable trends based on the data are
 1. When considering the Max Temperature vs City Latitude, and as expected, those cities located closer to the equator had warmer weather and the max temperature fell the farther from the equator cities in the north were located.
 2. There was no correlation between Humidity percentages or Cloudiness of a city and their proximity to the equator.
 3. The wind speed for the most of the cluster of cities remained between 10-20mph regardless of thier proximity to the equator.
